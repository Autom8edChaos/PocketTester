# Test assignment

We are looking for Automation Engineers that have the mindset "only the sky is the limit" and "automation doesn't stop at testing, it's just a beginning!" ;)

The purpose of this test assignment is to assess the applicant's automation skills, allowing him/her to show the best they can do and how fast they can learn.
It is an open assignment. There is no the right answer and there is no end goal other than proving yourself. Surprise us!

Make sure that you give detailed comments or descriptions of your tests.
When the assignment is complete, please push your solution to Github(Gitlab) and send us the link to hr.grid.adi@nl.abnamro.com.
If you have any questions, please contact us at hr.grid.adi@nl.abnamro.com.

Good luck.

PS. We don't expect you to spend weeks (and sleepless nights) on doing it. Lets see how far you can get in 6-10 hours. We want to see how you approach and solve problems.

PSPS. Please use mobile native tools. (Tests written on Java are accepted too)

# Start

After the first look at the code behind the assignment, it looked quite empty. There is not much fun in testing an application that does almost nothing, so we need to change
that. After some thinking I wanted to make a Note Taking app that could be handy during testing. I remembered the Course Note app from Jim Wilson and thought "Why not,
lets create an app first with the help of that material!"

# PocketTester

You are sitting in the train home. While dozing away a little, suddenly a great test idea pops up in your mind: "If we can mock the HTTP calls, we can test every state in
the App without having to setup testdata on the server!". You want to note that idea down and maybe share it with someone, but how? Well, now there is an app for that: PocketTester!

Do you encounter a bug and want to quickly write it down, use PocketTester!  
Do you want to share your test check list with your collegues, just mail it to them with PocketTester!
